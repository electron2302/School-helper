# School-helper

School-helper is a small project witch I started out of frustration while writing with the Laptop in Class.
The main part of the programm is the smal icon (Windows Menu Item) that it sporns. on right click you can make most of the actions of the Programm.
The windows from is only for configuring the Program, normaly it is hidden and its windos tray icon is hiden as well, but it is fisable if you do alt-tab (maybe someone can fix that)
The Purpos of this project is to create empty .odt files in the right folder and with "yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm" as there file name. because i was loosing track of all the untiteld docs. 
It cann also copy a Blank.odt file witch you have writen once (with the right header and your name allready in it for example) instead of creating empty files.

Feel free to use or modify the code to your needs and liking.
I would be honored if my little project could simplify someone's Altag :)
